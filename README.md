Empowering buyers and sellers in a vibrant online marketplace.

Team:
On this project i will be working alone, therefore i will be taking all the project roles.

Technologies:Libraries, Languages, Platforms, Frameworks:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: mysql
Trade-offs:
For backend development, another option could be using Python with Django framework. While Django offers a robust set of features for rapid development, we chose Node.js and Express.js for their lightweight and scalable nature, which aligns better with the project's requirements for real-time updates and asynchronous processing.
For the database, an alternate option could be PostgreSQL. While PostgreSQL is known for its reliability and ACID compliance, we opted for MongoDB due to its flexibility in handling unstructured data and ease of scalability, which are essential for an e-commerce platform where product attributes may vary.

Challenge statement:
The E-commerce Marketplace Platform is intended to solve the problem of facilitating online transactions between buyers and sellers, providing a convenient and secure platform for conducting e-commerce activities.Limitations:
The platform will not solve issues related to logistics, shipping, or product quality control, as these aspects are beyond the scope of the digital platform.
   Target Users:
The platform will help both individual sellers and businesses by providing them with a platform to reach a broader audience and increase sales. Additionally, it will benefit consumers by offering a wide range of products and services in a centralized marketplace.Locale:
The project is not dependent on a specific locale and can be accessed globally, although localization features may be implemented in the future to cater to different regions and languages.








Risks:
      Technical Risks:
Potential impact: Technical issues or bugs could affect the platform's functionality, leading to a negative user experience and loss of trust.
Safeguards: Regular code reviews, automated testing, and thorough debugging processes will be implemented to identify and address technical issues promptly.
     Non-Technical Risks:
Potential impact: Market competition, changes in consumer behavior, or regulatory issues could impact the platform's growth and sustainability.
Strategies: Continuous market research, adaptation to emerging trends, and compliance with regulations will mitigate non-technical risks and ensure the platform's long-term viability.

Infrastructure:
Branching and Merging: We will adopt the GitHub flow for branching and merging, utilizing feature branches for development and pull requests for code review and integration into the main branch.
Deployment Strategy: The platform will be deployed using a cloud-based infrastructure, such as AWS or Heroku, with continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automated deployment of code changes.
Data Population: Initially, the platform will be populated with sample data for testing purposes. Once deployed, sellers will add their products, and users will contribute user-generated content through interactions on the platform.
Testing Tools and Automation:T Testing will be automated using tools such as Jest for unit testing, Cypress for end-to-end testing, and Postman for API testing. Continuous integration pipelines will run tests automatically on code changes to ensure stability and reliability.

Existing Solutions:
Amazon: Amazon is a well-established e-commerce marketplace that connects buyers and sellers worldwide. Similarities include product listings, shopping cart functionality, and secure payment processing. However, our platform aims to differentiate itself through a more streamlined user experience, personalized recommendations, and a focus on supporting small and independent sellers.
eBay: eBay is another popular online marketplace known for its auction-style listings and diverse product categories. While our platform shares similarities in facilitating transactions between buyers and sellers, it distinguishes itself by offering curated product recommendations, seller ratings, and a modern, responsive user interface.
